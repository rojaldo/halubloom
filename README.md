## IDEA 

QT4 webview over a flask app


## Notice 
I'm new to python and I'm going to improve my python knowledge. I was looking for new way to create desktop applications. Create this project for learning purpose. Maybe/surely my codes need to more improvements.

## How to use

add your routes in `routes.py`

ex: 

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')
  
```
then run your desktop app 

`> python pyfladesk.py`

#### Sample RSS Reader app

I wrote a sample Rss reader app by PyFladesk. you can find [here](https://github.com/smoqadam/PyFladesk-rss-reader).

it works fine in Windows 7 but I didn't test it in Linux or OSx. if you did it please let me know about it.
